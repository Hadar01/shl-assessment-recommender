❌ No clear entry points
❌ Different audience types confused

### After Organization
✅ Documentation organized by purpose (setup, architecture, evaluation, submission)
✅ Multiple clear entry points (README, QUICK_START, INDEX)
✅ Audience-specific navigation paths
✅ Comprehensive guides for each topic
✅ Professional repository presentation
