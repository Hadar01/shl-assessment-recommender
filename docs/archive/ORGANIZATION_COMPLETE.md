# 🎯 Repository Organization Complete

Your repository is now **professionally organized** with clear navigation and logical structure.

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. **Created Documentation Hub** (`docs/INDEX.md`)
   - Central navigation for all documentation
   - Quick links organized by task and audience
   - Clear pathways based on what users need

### 2. **Organized by Purpose** (4 documentation categories)
   ```
   docs/
   ├── setup/          → Getting started & deployment
   ├── architecture/   → System design & code structure
   ├── evaluation/     → Performance metrics & analysis
   └── submission/     → Deliverables & verification
   ```

### 3. **Created Comprehensive Guides**
   - ✅ **QUICK_START.md** - 5-minute setup guide
   - ✅ **SYSTEM_DESIGN.md** - Architecture with diagrams
   - ✅ **CODE_STRUCTURE.md** - Module organization & dependencies
   - ✅ **METRICS.md** - Performance analysis & optimization history
   - ✅ **DELIVERABLES.md** - Verification checklist
   - ✅ **REPOSITORY_ORGANIZATION.md** - How to navigate the repo

### 4. **Updated README.md**
   - Added documentation reference table
   - Quick start section
   - Architecture overview
   - Clear next steps by audience type

## 🗺️ Documentation Structure

```
README.md                          ← Entry point (updated with links)

    ├→ docs/setup/QUICK_START.md               (5-minute setup)
    ├→ docs/architecture/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md      (Architecture overview)
    ├→ docs/architecture/CODE_STRUCTURE.md     (Code organization)
    ├→ docs/evaluation/METRICS.md              (Performance analysis)
    └→ docs/submission/DELIVERABLES.md         (Verification)
    
REPOSITORY_ORGANIZATION.md         ← How to navigate repo
```

## 🎯 Navigation by Task

### "I'm new - where do I start?"
```
README.md → QUICK_START.md (5 min) → docs/INDEX.md (for more)
```

### "I want to understand the system"
```
README.md → SYSTEM_DESIGN.md → CODE_STRUCTURE.md
```

### "I need to verify it works"
```
QUICK_START.md → Run API/UI → DELIVERABLES.md (checklist)
```

### "I want to see performance"
```
METRICS.md → Metrics overview
Run: python -m scripts.evaluate_train ...
```

### "I'm a code reviewer"
```
CODE_STRUCTURE.md → shlrec/recommender.py → shlrec/retrieval.py
```
